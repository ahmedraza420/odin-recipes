# Odin Recipes
A simple webpage made as an assignment project assigned during The Odin Project Foundations course. I already know HTMl, but sometimes it's good to revisit the basics.

# What does it do?
The Home page has a list of three delicious dishes. Clicking on a Dish name will open it's recipe along with the nutritional facts of that dish.

The recipes were copied from [allrecipes.com](https://www.allrecipes.com//)
